The original data is from an experiment with a group of 30 volunteers wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. The collected data is from the accelerometers from this smartphone and can be downloaded from:

 ## Steps for the Project
 1. The original data was merged to create one big data set in the following way: 
 
  |   features.txt   | "Activity_ID" |   "Subject_ID"    |
  |------------------|:-------------:|------------------:|
  |    X_train.txt   |  y_train.txt  | subject_train.txt |
  |    X_test.txt    |  y_test.txt   | subject_train.txt |
 
 2. From this dataset was extract only the columns of mean and standard deviation and the "Activity_ID" and "Subject_ID" columns.
 
 3. The column "Activity_ID", that has the integers that represents each type of activity, was replaced with the "Activity" columns, that has the names of each activity followin the map below:
 
  * 1 WALKING
  * 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
  * 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  * 4 SITTING
  * 5 STANDING
  * 6 LAYING
 
 4. The original variables names, such as `tBodyAccMag-mean()`, were replaced with better descriptive names, such as `TimeBodyAccelerationMagnitudeMean`.
 
 5. An independent tidy data set was created with the mean of each activity and each subject. This new dataset was saved in the `tidy_data.txt` file.
 
## Variables 
  
There are 180 observations of 68 variables, where the `Activity` variable is a factor, the `Subject_ID` is an integer and the other variables are numbers.
**Activity**: The activity performed for each subject. One of WALKING,  WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.
**Subject_ID**: The subject identifier. From 1 to 30.
**TimeBodyAccelerationMean-X**: The mean of tBodyAcc-mean()-X for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeBodyAccelerationMean-Y**: The mean of tBodyAcc-mean()-Y for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeBodyAccelerationMean-Z**: The mean of tBodyAcc-mean()-Z for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeBodyAccelerationStdDev-X**: The mean of tBodyAcc-std()-X for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeBodyAccelerationStdDev-Y**: The mean of tBodyAcc-std()-Y for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeBodyAccelerationStdDev-Z**: The mean of tBodyAcc-std()-Z for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeGravityAccelerationMean-X**: The mean of tGravityAcc-mean()-X for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeGravityAccelerationMean-Y**: The mean of tGravityAcc-mean()-Y for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeGravityAccelerationMean-Z**: The mean of tGravityAcc-mean()-Z for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeGravityAccelerationStdDev-X**: The mean of tGravityAcc-std()-X for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeGravityAccelerationStdDev-Y**: The mean of tGravityAcc-std()-Y for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeGravityAccelerationStdDev-Z**: The mean of tGravityAcc-std()-Z for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeBodyAccelerationJerkMean-X**: The mean of tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeBodyAccelerationJerkMean-Y**: The mean of tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeBodyAccelerationJerkMean-Z**: The mean of tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeBodyAccelerationJerkStdDev-X**: The mean of tBodyAccJerk-std()-X for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeBodyAccelerationJerkStdDev-Y**: The mean of tBodyAccJerk-std()-Y for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeBodyAccelerationJerkStdDev-Z**: The mean of tBodyAccJerk-std()-Z for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeBodyGyroscopeMean-X**: The mean of tBodyGyro-mean()-X for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeBodyGyroscopeMean-Y**: The mean of tBodyGyro-mean()-Y for each combination of Activity and Subject
**TimeBodyGyroscopeMean-Z**: The mean of tBodyGyro-mean()-Z for each combination of Activity and Subject
